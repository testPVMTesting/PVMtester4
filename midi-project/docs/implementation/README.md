# Implementation

This folder contains step-by-step instructions of how
to implement your MIDI project.

Initially, the test files are *not* included in your project,
this because otherwise you'd have to finish the entire
project before being able to actually run the tests.

For every step in this walkthrough, there is a corresponding
test suite in the project. Right click on it in the project explorer
and select "Include In Project". You can then proceed
to write code to make these tests pass.

You are of course free to comment out some tests
so as to make a more gradual development possible.
With each passing test, you can uncomment the next one.

You are not allowed to modify the tests in anyway
unless explicitly mentioned otherwise. If you think
some tests make unnecessary assumptions,
send me an email so that I can take it into consideration.
